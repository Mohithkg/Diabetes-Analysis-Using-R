CONCLUSION

The results of the analysis revealed key risk factors associated with diabetes in the Pima Indian
community, such as age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin levels, and more. The predictive model built in this
project can be used by medical practitioners to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients and to guide
prevention and management strategies.
The findings of this project have important implications for the health and well-being of the Pima Indian
community. The report generated from this analysis can be used by healthcare providers, researchers, and
policy-makers in developing targeted interventions to reduce the burden of diabetes in this population.
In conclusion, the Diabetes Data Anal
of data analysis in better understanding the factors that contribute to the high incidence of diabetes in the
Pima Indian community and in providing recommendations for reducing its impact. The project has
highlighted the importance of ongoing research and interventions aimed at improving the health and wellbeing
of this population.
By this project we are able to build the predictive models and know how to analyze the data for health
insights of people , plots to visualise the data , correlation to know the relation of variables ,
t-tests to test the Hypothesis , Logistic Regression to predict the outcome , Decision trees to predict the
outcome and accuracy of models.
