ABSTRACT

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The Pima Indian community in Arizona is one of the populations
that has a high incidence of diabetes. The aim of this project is to use the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset to analyze the risk factors associated with
diabetes in this population. The dataset contains medical records of few patients and includes various parameters.

The project will employ data and statistical analysis techniques to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and the likelihood of diabetes. 
Exploratory data analysis will be performed to identify any trends or patterns in the data, and various statistical models will be used to build a predictive model. 
This will help in identifying the key risk factors and help medical practitioners in predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients.

The results of the analysis will be used to generate a report that summarizes the findings and provides recommendations for diabetes prevention and management in
the Pima Indian community. The report will be beneficial for healthcare providers, researchers, and policy-makers in developing targeted interventions to reduce 
the burden of diabetes in this population.

Overall, this project aims to use statistical and data analysis to better understand the factors that contribute to the high incidence of diabetes in 
the Pima Indian community and to provide recommendations for reducing its impact.
